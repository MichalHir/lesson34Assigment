inheritence:
<!-- 1. **Create a Parent Class: `Vehicle`**
   - Define a class `Vehicle` that will serve as the base class for other types of vehicles.
   - Implement a method called `number_of_wheels()` that raises a `NotImplementedError`. This method will be overridden in the subclasses.

2. **Create Subclasses: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck`**
   - **Car**:
     - Add a property `number_of_doors` to represent the number of doors in the car.
     - Override the `number_of_wheels()` method to return `4`.
     - Implement a method `has_trunk()` that returns `True`, assuming all cars have a trunk. -->
   <!-- - **Motorcycle**:
     - Add a property `has_sidecar` to indicate whether the motorcycle has a sidecar.
     - Override the `number_of_wheels()` method to return `2` if there is no sidecar, or `3` if there is.
     - Implement a method `wheelie()` that returns a string indicating whether the motorcycle can perform a wheelie (only possible without a sidecar). -->
   <!-- - **Truck**:
     - Add a property `load_capacity` to represent the truck's load capacity in tons.
     - Override the `number_of_wheels()` method to return `18`, assuming a typical large truck.
     - Implement a method `is_heavy_load()` that returns `True` if the load capacity is greater than 10 tons, otherwise `False`. -->

<!-- 3. **Main Program:**
   - Create instances of the `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck` classes.
   - Call the `number_of_wheels()` method on each instance to verify that it returns the correct number of wheels.
   - Access and print the unique properties (`number_of_doors`, `has_sidecar`, `load_capacity`) of each subclass.
   - Call and print the results of the unique methods (`has_trunk()`, `wheelie()`, `is_heavy_load()`) for each subclass. -->

api Excercise
1. Make this program work with pet class:
https://github.com/ranerlich7/flask_pet_api_basic_no_db
2. Give to chat gpt and ask it to make it in oop - using classes
3. Take a look at sqlalchemy solution
    Dbmodel
